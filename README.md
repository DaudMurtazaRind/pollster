# pollster

This is my first ever django project. Its a polling app, where you can participate in polls, and view thier results. The landing page displays a message where you can view available polls, when you click the link, it takes you to polls. This is where you can either view results or vote in a poll. I am using django 3, and Python3.8, for DB I have used Sqlite3.
